## What is it?
- It's the average of all values in a set, as defined by:
	- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Coverline%7Bx%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%7Bx_i%7D)
	- translation: "x-bar equals one over the number in the sample, times the sum of all values from 1 to last (n) in the sample (x sub i)"
- mean's symbol is:
	- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Coverline%7Bx%7D) for a sample ("x-bar")
	- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%7B%5Cmu%7D) for a population ("mu")
